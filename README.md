####For the piepline 

1. Open the folder SentimentalAnalysis and Run Driver.py for instantiating Listener Class

The code for pipeline is present in SentimentalPipeline folder under the parent code directory and 
first you will have to run the driver.py to start the Tweet Listener Class. Once the class is started,
you can run senana.py to start retrieving data from twitter. The tweets will be saved in parquet files in parc directory in SentimentalPipeline folder. 
3. Run parquetparserpy to combine parquet scores.
